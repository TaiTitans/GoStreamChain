# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
Chạy local Hardhat node:
npx hardhat node
Deploy contract lên local:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Xong deploy → lấy contract address để phục vụ cho app GoStreamChain.
```
